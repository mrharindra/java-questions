  Problem:
   -------------------------------
   In a particular social network site, friends are automatically allocated to users by system.
   User can not add friends of their choice.
   
   Their are currently N users on the sites labeled as 2 to N+1.
   For every i user (where i ranges from 2 to N+1), the system allocated 
   all the users labeled with multiple of i as user's friend.
   For example: 
   		- 4,6,8,... will be friend of 2
   		- 6,9,12,... will be friend of 3
     
   One day all user come together for a meeting and they form groups such that 
   each person in a group is direct friend OR friend of friend of every other person in that group.
   For example: 
   	 6 is direct of 2 and 6 is also direct friend of 3,
     so 2 and 3 are friend (of friend) hence will be in same group.
       
     
   Find the total no of groups?
   -------------------------------
   Input:    
    N    - denoting the number of users on the site.
    
   Output:
    No of groups as given in problem
    
    
    -------------------------------  
   Sample Input and Output:
   Example 1:
    	Input: 5
    	Output: 2
    
        Explanation:
        	Users are 2,3,4,5,6   
        	So 2 groups will be formed as below
            (2,3,4,6) and (5)
          
   Example 1:
    	Input: 10
    	Output: 3
    
        Explanation:
        	Users are 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11   
        	So 3 groups will be formed as below
            (2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10) and (7) and (11)
